Welcome to GSDM's documentation!
================================

The GSDM application was developed in a collaboration between The Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) and the International Center for Tropical Agriculture. The project was funded by Formas/SIDA (contract: 220-1975-2013) together with Västra Götalandsregionen (VGR; Sweden) and formed part of the CGIAR Research Program on Water, Land and Ecosystems (WLE). The web application is provided as is and we take no responsibility for any damage caused by using it.
